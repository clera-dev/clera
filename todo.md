# Notes to track to-do list

# 3/14/2025
I need to run frontend-app and, once authenticated, build out the functionality of creating a user account on Alpaca.
Will need to:
* make a account form for the user to fill out that contains all info Alpaca needs
* make sure that properly makes an account on the alpaca sandbox mode (make sure that's turned on)
* store user data into Supabase

Once that's done:
* Build out the "investments" tab to search for securities
* when the user clicks on a security and enters a notional amount, make sure they can actually "invest" in that. (just worry about buy buttons for now - we can implement sell characteristics in the portfolio tab since we don't allow people to short their investments.)
* make sure this actually populates in alpaca broker dashboard!
