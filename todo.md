# Notes to track to-do list

# 3/24/2025
* Need to fix the bug with doing ACH transfer via plaid.
* then, I need to prompt the user to find their account w a certain notional amt

Once that's done:
* Build out the "investments" tab to search for securities
* when the user clicks on a security and enters a notional amount, make sure they can actually "invest" in that. (just worry about buy buttons for now - we can implement sell characteristics in the portfolio tab since we don't allow people to short their investments.)
* make sure this actually populates in alpaca broker dashboard!
