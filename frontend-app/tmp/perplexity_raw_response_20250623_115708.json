The current portfolio is heavily concentrated in AAPL (55.9%), with some exposure to bonds (FLOT) and broad market (SPY). The goal is to build long-term wealth through aggressive growth.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Age: 22-23, recent graduate with 30+ year time horizon\n- High risk tolerance (aggressive profile)\n- Strong interest in technology sector\n- Current portfolio has poor diversification (diversification score 1.6/10)\n- Need to reduce AAPL concentration while maintaining growth focus\n- Annual investment capacity of ~$10,000 allows for incremental diversification\n\nThe approach will be:\n1. Create 4 personalized investment themes that align with growth and technology focus while introducing diversification.\n2. Recommend exactly 6 individual stocks that represent aggressive growth opportunities across different sectors.\n3. Include a market analysis section covering current environment and risks.\n\nInvestment Themes (4 themes required):\n1. Theme 1: Next-Gen Computing & AI Revolution\n   - Focus on companies leading in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and advanced semiconductors.\n   - Relevant to user's tech interest while diversifying beyond consumer hardware (AAPL).\n   - Cite sources on AI growth trends [12][15]\n\n2. Theme 2: Cybersecurity Transformation\n   - Capitalize on increasing cyber threats and cloud security adoption.\n   - Provides exposure to a high-growth tech subsector different from AAPL's core business.\n   - Supported by market growth data [13][19]\n\n3. Theme 3: Biotechnology Breakthroughs\n   - Focus on innovative biotech firms in genomics, personalized medicine, and drug development.\n   - Offers diversification into healthcare sector with high growth potential.\n   - Based on promising biotech research [9][10][11]\n\n4. Theme 4: Emerging Markets Innovation\n   - Target high-growth companies in emerging markets, particularly in tech and consumer sectors.\n   - Addresses geographic diversification gap in current portfolio.\n   - Supported by top-performing EM ETFs data [5]\n\nStock Recommendations (6 stocks required):\nWe'll select stocks that:\n- Represent different sub-sectors within technology and growth\n- Have strong growth prospects and recent positive analyst coverage\n- Align with the investment themes above\n- Help diversify away from AAPL concentration\n\nProposed stocks:\n1. NVDA (Nvidia) - AI chip leader, thematic fit for AI revolution [12]\n2. CRWD (CrowdStrike) - Cybersecurity leader with strong growth [8][13]\n3. BNTX (BioNTech) - Biotech innovator in mRNA and cancer therapies [11]\n4. TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor) - Key semiconductor foundry with EM exposure [15]\n5. SEZL (Sezzle) - High-growth fintech in BNPL space [3][7]\n6. GEV (GE Vernova) - Renewable energy leader for diversification [6]\n\nMarket Analysis:\n- Current Environment: Bullish for growth stocks despite some volatility; AI and renewable energy driving innovation.\n- Risk Factors: Geopolitical tensions, interest rate uncertainty, and valuation concerns in tech sector.\n\nNow we'll structure the response in the exact JSON format required, with detailed rationales.\n</think>\n{\n\"investment_themes\": [\n{\n\"title\": \"AI Infrastructure Revolution\",\n\"summary\": \"Capitalize on the accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence across industries through companies building foundational AI technologies.\",\n\"report\": \"The AI infrastructure theme represents a generational investment opportunity driven by the convergence of accelerated computing, cloud adoption, and enterprise AI deployment. Current market analysis indicates the global AI chip market alone is projected to grow at a 38% CAGR through 2030, with NVIDIA commanding over 80% market share in AI accelerators. This growth is fueled by massive cloud hyperscaler capex ($200B+ annually) targeting AI infrastructure and the proliferation of large language models across industries. For a young investor with high risk tolerance, this theme provides leveraged exposure to technological megatrends while diversifying away from consumer hardware. The timing is particularly opportune given recent 30% pullbacks in leading AI stocks from January 2025 peaks, creating attractive entry points. With your 30-year horizon, this positions you at the forefront of the $15 trillion AI productivity wave just beginning to transform global economies.\",\n\"relevant_tickers\": [\"NVDA\", \"AVGO\", \"TSM\"]\n},\n{\n\"title\": \"Cybersecurity Dominance\",\n\"summary\": \"Target companies leading the essential defense against escalating cyber threats in our increasingly digital world.\",\n\"report\": \"Cybersecurity has transitioned from IT cost center to strategic business imperative, with global cybercrime damages projected to reach $13.8 trillion annually by 2028.

For your portfolio, this theme provides critical diversification into a non-cyclical growth sector with recession-resistant characteristics. The technological arms race against AI-powered cyber threats ensures sustained 20%+ revenue growth for category leaders through 2030.

The MSCI Emerging Markets Index trades at just 12x forward earnings versus 20x for S&P 500, creating valuation arbitrage despite superior growth projections.
