Their current portfolio is highly concentrated in Apple (AAPL) and has poor diversification. They have an annual investment capacity of $10,000 and are interested in technology and aggressive growth.\n\n We must create:\n   - Exactly 4 investment themes, each with a title, summary, report (200-300 words), and 3-5 relevant tickers.\n   - Exactly 6 stock picks, each with a ticker, company name, and rationale (100-150 words).\n   - A market analysis section (150-200 words for current environment and 100-150 words for risk factors).\n\n We are required to use the most current information (as of June 2025) and cite recent analyst reports and market trends.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Analyze the user's current portfolio:\n    - High concentration in AAPL (55.9%) is risky.\n    - The rest is in FLOT (short-term bond ETF) and SPY (S&P 500 ETF).\n    - The portfolio is 100% equity but poorly diversified.\n\n 2. The user wants aggressive growth and has a long time horizon. We should recommend:\n    - Diversifying away from the heavy AAPL position.\n    - Investing in high-growth sectors (e.g., technology, AI, cloud computing, cybersecurity, green energy, emerging markets, etc.).\n    - Considering small-cap and mid-cap stocks for higher growth potential.\n\n 3. We have search results that provide context on:\n    - Aggressive growth ETFs (from [2], [3], [6])\n    - Best growth ETFs (from [4], [6])\n    - AI stocks (from [9])\n    - Cloud computing stocks (from [10], [15])\n    - Cybersecurity stocks (from [11])\n    - Green energy stocks (from [12])\n    - Emerging markets ETFs (from [13])\n    - Small-cap ETFs (from [14])\n\n 4. We must create 4 investment themes that are personalized to the user. Each theme should:\n    - Be technology-oriented (given user's interest) but also include other growth areas.\n    - Address diversification needs by including different sectors and market caps.\n    - Include 3-5 tickers that are not the same as the 6 stock picks.\n\n 5. We must pick 6 individual stocks that are:\n    - Based on fundamental analysis and current market conditions.\n    - Supported by recent analyst reports (last 3 months).\n    - Align with the investment themes.\n\n 6. Market analysis should cover:\n    - Current environment (June 2025): Mention key trends (e.g., AI boom, cloud computing growth, cybersecurity demands, green energy transition, emerging markets recovery).\n    - Risk factors: Inflation, interest rates, geopolitical tensions, sector-specific risks.\n\n 7. Use the search results to support our recommendations.\n\n Let's plan:\n\n Investment Themes (4):\n   Theme 1: \"AI and Semiconductor Dominance\"\n      Summary: Capitalize on the explosive growth in artificial intelligence and the foundational semiconductor industry.\n      Report: Discuss the AI boom, demand for chips, and companies leading in this space. Use data from [9] (NVIDIA, Broadcom) and [6] (Invesco QQQ). Relevant tickers: NVDA, AVGO, AMD, SMCI (Super Micro Computer) - from [9].\n\n   Theme 2: \"Cloud Computing Revolution\"\n      Summary: Invest in companies enabling the global shift to cloud infrastructure and services.\n      Report: Cloud computing market growth (from [10], [15]). Companies: Cloudflare (NET), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) - from [10], and others. Relevant tickers: NET, PANW, SNOW (Snowflake) - from [10] and [9].\n\n   Theme 3: \"Cybersecurity Leadership\"\n      Summary: Target the essential and rapidly expanding cybersecurity sector.\n      Report: Increasing cyber threats and regulatory demands (from [11]). Companies: CyberArk (CYBR), SentinelOne (S) - from [11]. Relevant tickers: CYBR, S, CRWD (CrowdStrike - not in search but top player).\n\n   Theme 4: \"Emerging Markets and Small-Cap Growth\"\n      Summary: Capture high-growth opportunities in emerging markets and undervalued small-cap companies.\n      Report: Diversification beyond US, high growth potential in emerging markets (from [13]) and small-caps (from [14]). Relevant tickers: ARGT (Argentina ETF), EPOL (Poland ETF), DFAS (small-cap ETF) - from [13] and [14].\n\n Stock Picks (6):\n   We need to pick 6 stocks that are different from the theme tickers. They should be strong growth stocks with recent positive analyst coverage.\n\n   Stock 1: NVIDIA (NVDA) - AI leader, strong growth, recent earnings beat. From [9].\n   Stock 2: Broadcom (AVGO) - Semiconductor and infrastructure software, AI demand. From [9].\n   Stock 3: Palo Alto Networks (PANW) - Cybersecurity leader, AI-powered solutions. From [11].\n   Stock 4: Cloudflare (NET) - Cloud security and performance. From [10].\n   Stock 5: CyberArk (CYBR) - Identity security leader. From [11].\n   Stock 6: Docebo (DCBO) - Cloud-based learning platform, long-term growth. From [15].\n\n   Note: We must ensure these are not in the theme tickers. The theme tickers are for additional exposure, so the stock picks can be the main ones.\n\n   However, note that the user already holds AAPL and we are not selling in this recommendation, so we are focusing on new investments.\n\n   We might also consider one non-tech to diversify? But the user is interested in tech. Alternatively, we can include a green energy stock?\n\n   But the instructions say: \"Prioritize growth-oriented investments unless user profile indicates otherwise\". The user has a strong interest in tech.\n\n   We have 6 stocks, all in tech-related sectors. This is acceptable given the user's interest and the current market trends.\n\n Market Analysis:\n   Current Environment: AI-driven market, strong performance in tech, cloud, and cybersecurity. Economic resilience but inflation concerns. Interest rates may stabilize. \n   Risk Factors: High valuations in tech, regulatory scrutiny, geopolitical risks (especially in emerging markets), and potential economic slowdown.\n\n Now, we write the JSON.\n\n Important: We must cite recent analyst reports and current data (as of June 2025).\n\n Let's structure the JSON:\n\n {\n   \"investment_themes\": [\n      { \"title\": \"...\", \"summary\": \"...\", \"report\": \"... (200-300 words)\", \"relevant_tickers\": [\"...\", \"...\"] },\n      ... (4 themes)\n   ],\n   \"stock_picks\": [\n      { \"ticker\": \"...\", \"company_name\": \"...\", \"rationale\": \"... (100-150 words)\" },\n      ... (6 stocks)\n   ],\n   \"market_analysis\": {\n      \"current_environment\": \"... (150-200 words)\",\n      \"risk_factors\": \"... (100-150 words)\"\n   }\n }\n\n We must use the most current information and cite sources appropriately.\n\n Let's create the content.\n</think>\n{\n\"investment_themes\": [\n{\n\"title\": \"AI Infrastructure Expansion\",\n\"summary\": \"Capitalize on the accelerating demand for artificial intelligence computing infrastructure\",\n\"report\": \"The AI infrastructure sector represents a foundational investment opportunity driven by unprecedented demand for computational power.
