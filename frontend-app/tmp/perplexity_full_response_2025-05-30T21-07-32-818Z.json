        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the user's profile. They're a recent graduate in their early 20s with a high risk tolerance and a very long time horizon of 30+ years. Their current portfolio is heavily concentrated in Apple (55.9%), which poses significant concentration risk. They also have some exposure to bonds via FLOT and the S&P 500 through SPY, but the diversification score is very low. The main goals are long-term wealth building with an aggressive growth approach, and they're interested in technology but open to diversification.\n\nFirst, I need to address the concentration risk in AAPL. The search results mention strategies like outright sales, charitable contributions of shares, or hedging with collars [3][13]. Since the user is young and has a high risk tolerance, selling a portion of AAPL to reinvest in diversified growth opportunities makes sense. They can do this over time to manage tax implications, as suggested in [13].\n\nNext, building an aggressive growth portfolio. The search results highlight aggressive strategies like focusing on high-growth sectors such as AI, semiconductors, cloud computing, and green energy [5][7][16][18][20]. The user's interest in tech aligns with these sectors. The Permanent Portfolio's Aggressive Growth strategy emphasizes staying fully invested in stocks and diversifying across industries [1], which the user should adopt.\n\nLooking at the current portfolio, moving from 57.5% individual stocks (mostly AAPL) to a mix of individual growth stocks and sector-specific ETFs could improve diversification. The Madison Aggressive Allocation Fund targets 80% equity exposure [2], but since the user wants 100% equity, sector ETFs like IWO (Russell 2000 Growth) or SMH (Semiconductors) [14][15] could provide exposure without single-stock risk.\n\nFor investment themes, AI and semiconductors are critical. Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) are top picks in AI chips [5][18]. Cloud computing leaders like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) are essential for growth [16]. Green energy and EVs are emerging sectors with long-term potential; Tesla (TSLA) and First Solar (FSLR) are mentioned in [7][20]. Biotech, particularly companies like Vertex (VRTX) and BioNTech (BNTX), offers high growth in healthcare innovation [6].\n\nStock recommendations should balance high-growth tech with diversification. Reducing AAPL to 20% and reallocating to sectors like AI (NVDA, AVGO, AMD), cloud (AMZN, MSFT), biotech (VRTX, BNTX), and green energy (FSLR, TSLA) would spread risk. Including ETFs like IWO and SMH adds small-cap growth and semiconductor exposure, which are aggressive yet diversified.\n\nThe user's high risk tolerance allows for significant equity exposure, but they need to avoid over-concentration. Each recommended stock should have strong growth catalysts, analyst support, and align with the themes. For example, Nvidia's dominance in AI chips [5], Broadcom's expansion in 5G and AI [18], and Vertex's pipeline in rare diseases [6] are all compelling.\n\nFinally, the market analysis should note current tech-driven growth, supported by AI and semiconductor demand, but warn of volatility from geopolitical issues, interest rates, and sector-specific risks. Regular portfolio rebalancing and gradual AAPL divestment will manage risk while capitalizing on growth opportunities.\n</think>\n{\n\"investment_themes\": [\n{\n\"title\": \"AI Semiconductor Dominance\",\n\"summary\": \"Capitalize on the accelerating demand for advanced chips powering artificial intelligence infrastructure.\",\n\"report\": \"The AI semiconductor market is projected to grow at a 38% CAGR through 2030, driven by hyperscale cloud providers and enterprise AI adoption[5][15]. This theme leverages your long time horizon and high risk tolerance by focusing on companies creating the foundational technology for machine learning workloads. Current industry dynamics show Nvidia maintaining 80% market share in AI accelerators while AMD and Broadcom gain traction in alternative architectures[5][15][18]. The recent 45% YoY increase in AI-related semiconductor R&D spending indicates sustained innovation in this space[18]. This aligns with your tech focus while diversifying beyond consumer hardware into enterprise and cloud infrastructure. Key catalysts include the $250B CHIPS Act funding rollout and emerging applications in edge AI deployments[5][18].\"\n},\n{\n\"title\": \"Cloud Computing Infrastructure\",\n\"summary\": \"Invest in the backbone providers enabling global digital transformation through scalable cloud solutions.\",\n\"report\": \"The cloud infrastructure market is expected to reach $1.2T by 2027, growing at 19% annually as enterprises shift workloads to hybrid environments[16].

First Solar's 25GW manufacturing expansion and Tesla's 50% battery cost reductions position these companies to dominate their verticals[7][20]. Policy catalysts include strengthened EPA emission rules and $370B in clean energy tax credits through the Inflation Reduction Act.
