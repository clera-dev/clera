# Redis Error Handling Fix - Production Grade

## Issue Addressed

**Problem**: Redis operations were not properly wrapped in try/catch blocks, causing entire API requests to fail when Redis experienced transient outages or connectivity issues.

**Impact**: 
- API endpoints would return 500 errors during Redis outages
- Users would experience service degradation even when the core functionality (FMP API) was working
- No graceful degradation when cache was unavailable

## Files Fixed

### 1. `frontend-app/app/api/fmp/chart/[symbol]/route.ts`
- **Redis Read Operations**: Wrapped `redisClient.get()` in try/catch
- **Redis Write Operations**: Wrapped `redisClient.setex()` in try/catch  
- **Redis Delete Operations**: Wrapped `redisClient.del()` in try/catch
- **JSON Parse Operations**: Wrapped JSON parsing in try/catch with Redis cleanup

### 2. `frontend-app/app/api/news/portfolio-summary/route.ts`
- **Lock Acquisition**: Wrapped `redisClient.set()` in try/catch
- **Lock Release**: Wrapped `redisClient.del()` in try/catch
- **Lock Checking**: Wrapped `redisClient.exists()` in try/catch

### 3. `frontend-app/app/api/news/trending/route.ts`
- **Lock Operations**: Wrapped all Redis lock operations in try/catch
- **Cache Refresh Tracking**: Wrapped `redisClient.get()` and `redisClient.set()` in try/catch

### 4. `frontend-app/app/api/news/watchlist/route.ts`
- **Lock Operations**: Wrapped all Redis lock operations in try/catch
- **Cache Refresh Tracking**: Wrapped `redisClient.get()` and `redisClient.set()` in try/catch

## Error Handling Strategy

### Graceful Degradation Pattern
```typescript
// Before: Would fail entire request
const cachedData = await redisClient.get(cacheKey);

// After: Continues without cache on Redis error
let cachedData: any = null;
try {
  cachedData = await redisClient.get(cacheKey);
} catch (redisError) {
  console.warn(`Redis read error for ${cacheKey}:`, redisError);
  // Continue without cache - don't fail the request
}
```

### Lock Management Pattern
```typescript
// Before: Would fail if Redis unavailable
const result = await redisClient.set(lockKey, '1', { nx: true, ex: ttl });

// After: Returns false on Redis error, continues gracefully
try {
  const result = await redisClient.set(lockKey, '1', { nx: true, ex: ttl });
  return result === 'OK';
} catch (redisError) {
  console.warn(`Redis lock acquisition failed for ${lockKey}:`, redisError);
  return false; // Indicate lock acquisition failed, but don't fail request
}
```

### Cache Cleanup Pattern
```typescript
// Before: Would fail if Redis unavailable during cleanup
await redisClient.del(cacheKey);

// After: Logs error but continues
try {
  await redisClient.del(cacheKey);
  console.log(`Removed invalid cached data for ${cacheKey}`);
} catch (redisError) {
  console.warn(`Failed to remove invalid cached data for ${cacheKey}:`, redisError);
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Improved Reliability**
- API endpoints continue working during Redis outages
- Users get data even when cache is unavailable
- No cascading failures from cache layer

### 2. **Better User Experience**
- Faster response times during cache misses (no Redis timeouts)
- Consistent service availability
- Graceful degradation instead of complete failure

### 3. **Operational Resilience**
- Reduced alert noise during Redis maintenance
- Easier troubleshooting (clear error logs)
- Better monitoring of Redis health

### 4. **Production Readiness**
- Follows industry best practices for cache error handling
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Proper resource cleanup

## Error Logging

All Redis errors are logged with appropriate levels:
- **Warnings**: For non-critical Redis operations (cache misses, lock failures)
- **Errors**: For critical Redis operations that affect functionality
- **Info**: For successful Redis operations and cache hits

## Testing Considerations

The fix ensures that:
1. **Cache hits work normally** when Redis is healthy
2. **Cache misses work normally** when Redis is healthy  
3. **API continues working** when Redis is unavailable
4. **Lock mechanisms degrade gracefully** when Redis is unavailable
5. **Data validation still occurs** even without cache

## Monitoring

Monitor these metrics to ensure the fix is working:
- Redis connection errors (should not cause API failures)
- Cache hit/miss ratios (should remain stable)
- API response times (should not spike during Redis outages)
- Error rates (should decrease during Redis issues)

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing:
1. **Circuit breaker pattern** for Redis operations
2. **Redis health checks** in API routes
3. **Fallback cache strategies** (local memory, file system)
4. **Redis connection pooling** for better performance
