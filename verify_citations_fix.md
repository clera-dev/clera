# Citations Fix Verification

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes
- **File**: `frontend-app/utils/services/langGraphStreamingService.ts`
  - Added `extractCitationsFromToolResponses()` method to extract citations from tool responses
  - Modified `processStreamChunk()` to extract citations from all messages (including tool responses)
  - Updated node update processing to include citations in metadata

### 2. Frontend Changes
- **File**: `frontend-app/utils/api/secure-chat-client.ts`
  - Added citation accumulation logic to handle citations from multiple chunks
  - Updated node update handling to extract citations from tool responses
  - Fixed Set iteration issues for better compatibility

- **File**: `frontend-app/components/chat/Chat.tsx`
  - Added auto-show logic for SourcesTab when citations are available
  - Added useEffect to automatically display sources when citations are present

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
The issue was that citations were being embedded in tool response text as HTML comments (`<!-- CITATIONS: url1,url2,url3 -->`), but the streaming service was only looking for citations in the final AI message, not in tool responses.

### 4. Solution Implemented
1. **Tool Response Processing**: Modified the streaming service to extract citations from all messages, including tool responses
2. **Citation Accumulation**: Updated the secure chat client to accumulate citations from all chunks
3. **UI Integration**: Added auto-show logic for the SourcesTab when citations are available
4. **Metadata Flow**: Ensured citations flow through the metadata system from backend to frontend

## How to Test

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. Start the backend server
2. Start the frontend application
3. Ask a question that triggers web search (e.g., "What's the latest news on Apple stock?")
4. Verify that:
   - The web search tool is called
   - Citations are extracted from the tool response
   - The SourcesTab appears automatically
   - Citations are displayed in the SourcesTab
   - Each citation is clickable and opens in a new tab

### Expected Behavior:
- When a web search is performed, citations should be automatically extracted
- The SourcesTab should appear at the bottom of the chat
- Citations should be displayed with proper formatting
- Users can click on citations to visit the source URLs

## Technical Details

### Citation Extraction Flow:
1. **Web Search Tool** (`financial_analyst_agent.py`):
   - Gets citations from Perplexity API response
   - Embeds them as HTML comments in the response text
   - Returns clean text with citation markers

2. **Streaming Service** (`langGraphStreamingService.ts`):
   - Extracts citations from all messages (including tool responses)
   - Passes citations through metadata
   - Cleans citation markers from display text

3. **Chat Client** (`secure-chat-client.ts`):
   - Accumulates citations from all chunks
   - Stores citations in state
   - Passes citations to UI components

4. **UI Components** (`Chat.tsx`, `SourcesTab.tsx`):
   - Displays citations in a ChatGPT-style sources tab
   - Auto-shows sources when citations are available
   - Provides clickable links to source URLs

## Performance Considerations
- Citation extraction is lightweight and doesn't impact search time
- Citations are processed asynchronously and don't block the main response
- The auto-show feature provides good UX without being intrusive

## Compatibility
- Maintains compatibility with existing features
- No breaking changes to the API
- Preserves existing search functionality
- Works with both streaming and non-streaming responses
