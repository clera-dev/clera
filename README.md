```
And you can track their progress in AWS > Elastic Container Service.

## Project Structure

The monorepo is organized into the following main directories:

-   `backend/`: Contains the Python-based backend services, including AI logic, API servers, and broker integrations.
-   `frontend-app/`: Houses the Next.js frontend application for `app.askclera.com`.
-   `docs/`: Documentation for the project, including detailed notes on backend and frontend architecture.
-   `packages/`: Shared code and utilities utilized across different parts of the stack.

## Backend (`backend/`)

The backend powers Clera's core functionalities, built primarily with Python.

**Key Components:**

*   **API Server (`api_server.py`):** A FastAPI application providing RESTful endpoints for chat, trade execution, company info, health checks, and Alpaca/Plaid operations (account creation, ACH funding).
*   **WebSocket Server (`server.py`):** Enables real-time communication, financial RAG, vector database connections (Pinecone), and voice capabilities (Retell integration).
*   **AI Agents (`clera_agents/`):** Utilizes LangGraph for orchestrating specialized agents:
    *   Financial Analyst Agent
    *   Portfolio Management Agent
    *   Trade Execution Agent
    *   Includes tools for portfolio and company analysis.
*   **Chatbots (`clera_chatbots/`):** Various chatbot implementations (frontend-facing, RAG-enabled with Perplexity/Llama).
*   **Conversational AI (`conversational_ai/`):** Integrates voice features using LiveKit, Deepgram (STT), and Cartesia (TTS).
*   **Broker Integration (`utils/alpaca/`):** Handles Alpaca Broker API interactions for account creation, management, and ACH funding via Plaid or manual entry.

### Market Data Management

**Tradable Assets Cache (`backend/data/tradable_assets.json`):**
*   **Auto-Updated:** This file is automatically refreshed every 24 hours from Alpaca's live market data API to ensure current tradable instruments are available to users.
*   **Content:** Contains all active, tradable US equities available through Alpaca, including stocks, ETFs, and other securities.
*   **Git Workflow:** When this file is modified by the automatic update process:
    1. **Do NOT commit directly to main branch**
    2. **Create a dedicated branch** for market data updates (e.g., `update/market-data-YYYY-MM-DD`)
    3. **Review changes** to ensure they represent legitimate new tradable assets
    4. **Merge via pull request** to maintain audit trail of market data changes
*   **Why This Matters:** New assets are regularly added to Alpaca's platform, and this system ensures users have access to the latest investment opportunities without manual intervention.

**Technologies:**

*   Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn
*   LangGraph, LangChain
*   LLMs: Groq, Perplexity, Anthropic Claude
*   Vector DB: Pinecone
*   Broker API: Alpaca
*   Bank Integration: Plaid
*   Voice: LiveKit, Deepgram, Cartesia, Retell
*   Database: Supabase (via API)

**Deployment:**

*   A hybrid model:
    *   Non-AI logic (API Server, integrations) deployed on AWS ECS using AWS Copilot.
    *   AI Agent workflows hosted on dedicated LangGraph servers.
*   Backend API accessible via AWS Load Balancer.

*(See `docs/backend-notes.md` for more details)*

## Frontend (`frontend-app/`)

The frontend provides the user interface for interacting with Clera, built with Next.js and TypeScript.

**Key Components:**

*   **App Router (`app/`):** Organizes routes, including authentication pages, API routes, dashboard, and protected areas.
*   **Authentication:** Integrates with Supabase for user sign-up, sign-in, email verification, password reset, and protected routes using middleware and server actions.
*   **UI Components (`components/`):** Reusable components built with TailwindCSS and Shadcn UI, including forms, cards, buttons, and theme switching.
*   **Broker Onboarding (`components/onboarding/`):** A multi-step flow guiding users through Alpaca account creation (contact info, personal details, disclosures, agreements).
*   **Bank Connection & Funding:** Supports bank account linking via Plaid (OAuth) or manual entry, and initiating ACH transfers.
*   **Dashboard (`app/dashboard/`):** Displays Alpaca account info, connected banks, transfer history, and funding status.
*   **Supabase Integration (`utils/supabase/`):** Uses client and server components for interacting with Supabase Auth and Database (storing onboarding status, bank connections, transfers).

**Technologies:**

*   Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript
*   TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI
*   Supabase (Auth, Database)
*   State Management: React Hooks, Server Actions
*   API Communication: Fetch API, Server Actions

**Deployment:**

*   Deployed via Vercel.
*   Utilizes Vercel's CI/CD, environment variable management, preview deployments, and global CDN.
*   Connects to the AWS-hosted backend API and LangGraph services.

# Real-Time Portfolio Value Tracking System

This system provides real-time updates of portfolio values for users of the Clera financial platform. It efficiently tracks the value of users' investment portfolios with minimal latency, enabling a responsive and engaging user experience.

## Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

1. **Symbol Collector**: Periodically scans all user accounts and creates a list of unique symbols that need to be monitored
2. **Market Data Consumer**: Subscribes to Alpaca's real-time market data for all tracked symbols
3. **Portfolio Calculator**: Computes portfolio values using the latest prices and account positions
4. **WebSocket Server**: Maintains connections with frontend clients and pushes portfolio updates
5. **Frontend Component**: Displays real-time portfolio values to users

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Redis server running
- Alpaca account with API keys (both Broker and Market Data API keys)
- Node.js 16+ (for frontend)

## Installation

### Backend

1. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install redis alpaca-py fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv
```

2. Configure environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:

```
# Alpaca API credentials
BROKER_API_KEY=your_broker_api_key
BROKER_SECRET_KEY=your_broker_secret_key
APCA_API_KEY_ID=your_market_data_api_key # same as trading API key
APCA_API_SECRET=your_market_data_secret_key # same as trading API key
ALPACA_SANDBOX=true  # Set to false for production

# Redis configuration
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_DB=0

# Service configuration
SYMBOL_COLLECTION_INTERVAL=300  # Seconds
PRICE_TTL=3600  # Seconds
MIN_UPDATE_INTERVAL=2  # Seconds
RECALCULATION_INTERVAL=30  # Seconds
WEBSOCKET_PORT=8001
WEBSOCKET_HOST=0.0.0.0
```

### Frontend

Add the WebSocket URL to your frontend environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:8001
```

## Running the System

### Option 1: Run all services together

```bash
cd backend
python -m portfolio_realtime.run_services
```

This will start all services in parallel.

### Option 2: Run services individually

For development or debugging, you can run each service in a separate terminal:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Symbol Collector
cd backend
python -m portfolio_realtime.symbol_collector

# Terminal 2 - Market Data Consumer
cd backend
python -m portfolio_realtime.market_data_consumer

# Terminal 3 - Portfolio Calculator
cd backend
python -m portfolio_realtime.portfolio_calculator

# Terminal 4 - WebSocket Server
cd backend
python -m portfolio_realtime.websocket_server
```

## Frontend Integration

To use the real-time portfolio value component in your frontend:

```jsx
import LivePortfolioValue from '@/components/portfolio/LivePortfolioValue';

// In your component:
<LivePortfolioValue accountId={accountId} />
```

## System Performance

- The system is designed to be highly efficient, even with a large number of users
- Market data is subscribed to only once per symbol, regardless of how many users hold that asset
- Redis is used for fast data storage and inter-service communication
- Updates are throttled to avoid overwhelming clients

## Monitoring and Testing

- Each service includes logging that can be used for monitoring
- The WebSocket server provides a `/health` endpoint for status checks
- Run tests with: `cd backend && python -m unittest discover tests`

## Deployment Considerations

- For production, host Redis with proper persistence and replication
- Use secure WebSocket connections (WSS) in production
- Scale the WebSocket server horizontally behind a load balancer for high availability
- Configure proper authentication for WebSocket connections

## Troubleshooting

- Check Redis connection if services are not communicating
- Verify Alpaca API keys have the necessary permissions
- Ensure market data subscriptions are properly configured
- Look for error messages in the service logs
