# Clera Web Page

## Components
Most components were pulled from [aceternity](https://ui.aceternity.com/). It builds copy/paste UI features using Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion animation.

Edits from original version: we used to use a WebGL spinning globe for the `NewsCard` but switched that out for a `World Map` aceternity component because WebGL isn't compatible with all devices.

## Database
We are using Supabase to handle all of the waitlist submissions (name and email).
