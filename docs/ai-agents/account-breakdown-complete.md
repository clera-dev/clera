## Key Features

### ✅ Account-Level Breakdown
- Shows each connected account separately (401k, IRA, brokerage, etc.)
- Displays account name, institution, and account type
- Lists holdings specific to each account

### ✅ Per-Account Metrics
- **Account Value** - Total value in that specific account
- **Percentage** - Account value as % of total portfolio
- **Holdings Count** - Number of securities in that account
- **Risk Score** - Account-specific risk (0-10 scale)
- **Diversification Score** - Account-specific diversification (0-10 scale)

### ✅ Account-Specific Holdings
- Top 5 holdings per account shown with:
  - Symbol
  - Dollar value in that account
  - Percentage of that account
- "+X more holdings" message if account has > 5 securities

### ✅ Multi-Account Support
- Handles users with multiple accounts (2, 3, 4+ accounts)
- Properly maps each security to its source account(s)
- Handles securities held in multiple accounts

## Technical Details

### Critical Bug Fix
**Issue:** Account IDs weren't matching because `group_holdings_by_account()` wasn't filtering by `user_id`, so it was pulling other users' data.

**Solution:**
```python
# BEFORE (wrong - mixed user data)
result = supabase.table('user_aggregated_holdings')\
    .select('symbol, account_contributions')\
    .in_('symbol', symbols)\
    .execute()

# AFTER (correct - user-specific data)
result = supabase.table('user_aggregated_holdings')\
    .select('symbol, account_contributions')\
    .eq('user_id', user_id)\  # ← CRITICAL FIX
    .in_('symbol', symbols)\
    .execute()
```

### Data Flow
```
1. PortfolioDataProvider.get_holdings()
   ↓ Returns 11 PortfolioHolding objects

2. AccountBreakdownService.get_account_information(user_id)
   ↓ Fetches account names/types from user_investment_accounts
   
3. AccountBreakdownService.group_holdings_by_account(holdings, user_id)
   ↓ Groups holdings by account using account_contributions field
   ↓ Maps: plaid_1R6Vqqj... → [SBSI, CAMYX, NHX105509, ...]
   ↓ Maps: plaid_Lkparr7y... → [EWZ, NFLX...]

4. For each account:
   - Look up account name/type in account_info
   - Calculate total account value
   - Calculate per-account risk/diversification
   - Format holdings list
```

### Files Modified

1. **`backend/clera_agents/services/account_breakdown_service.py`**
   - Added `user_id` parameter to `group_holdings_by_account()`
   - Added `.eq('user_id', user_id)` filter to query

2. **`backend/clera_agents/portfolio_management_agent.py`**
   - Updated call to pass `user_id`
   - Integrated account breakdown into summary output

## Mode Compatibility
