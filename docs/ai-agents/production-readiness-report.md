## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor Issue: Foreign Key Constraint Errors (RESOLVED)
**Log Lines:** 681-710 in user's terminal output

**Error:**
```
Key (run_id)=(b8874751-...) is not present in table "chat_runs".
```

**Root Cause:**
`chat_tool_calls` were being inserted before `chat_runs` entry was created, causing foreign key constraint violations.

**Fix Applied:**
Changed `onRunStart` callback in `langGraphStreamingService.ts` from fire-and-forget to `await`:

```typescript
// BEFORE (fire and forget)
if (options.onRunStart) {
  options.onRunStart(...);  // Don't wait
}

// AFTER (wait for completion)
if (options.onRunStart) {
  await options.onRunStart(...);  // Wait for DB insert
}
```

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Impact:** None (fix already deployed)
**Action Required:** None

### Example User Flow

**User:** "How is my portfolio doing?"

**Clera:** 
> Tony, your portfolio is performing exceptionally well with a total value of $13,100.72 and an impressive unrealized gain of +$11,875.10 (that's a 968.91% return!). Your best performer is DBLTX with a +108.40% gain.
>
> However, there's a significant concentration risk I need to highlight - SBSI (Southside Bancshares) makes up 56.5% of your entire portfolio. While it's clearly been profitable, this level of concentration could expose you to unnecessary risk if that single stock faces challenges.
>
> Your diversification score is quite low at 1.6/10, which doesn't align well with your retirement and inheritance goals that benefit from more balanced exposure.
>
> Given your aggressive risk tolerance and long timeline, would you like me to suggest some rebalancing strategies to maintain your growth potential while reducing this concentration risk?

**Result:** User receives comprehensive, accurate, actionable advice. ✅
