# Personalized Onboarding Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Add a personalization questionnaire as the first step in the onboarding process to customize the user experience and AI agent responses. This will collect non-legal personal information before the existing legal onboarding steps.

**Timeline**: This is a major feature requiring careful implementation to maintain production-grade quality and avoid breaking existing functionality.

## üîç Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing Onboarding Flow
```
Current: welcome ‚Üí contact ‚Üí personal ‚Üí financial ‚Üí disclosures ‚Üí agreements ‚Üí loading ‚Üí success
New:     personalization ‚Üí welcome ‚Üí contact ‚Üí personal ‚Üí financial ‚Üí disclosures ‚Üí agreements ‚Üí loading ‚Üí success
```

**Key Files:**
- `frontend-app/components/onboarding/OnboardingFlow.tsx` - Main flow controller
- `frontend-app/components/onboarding/WelcomePage.tsx` - Current welcome page
- `frontend-app/lib/types/onboarding.ts` - Type definitions
- `frontend-app/app/actions.ts` - Server actions for data saving

### Chat System Architecture
**Message Flow:**
1. Frontend Chat Component ‚Üí `/api/chat/route.ts` 
2. API Route ‚Üí Backend `/api/chat-with-account`
3. Backend ‚Üí LangGraph Agent with config: `{user_id, account_id}`

**Key Injection Points:**
- Frontend: Where message is constructed before sending
- Backend: Where LangGraph config is built (potential context injection)

### Database Pattern
- Uses Supabase PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security
- JSONB columns for flexible data storage
- TypeScript enums for consistent data types
- Separate tables for different concerns (user_onboarding, user_bank_connections, etc.)

### Phase 1: Database Schema & Types

#### 1.1 Create user_personalization Table
```sql
-- Create user_personalization table
CREATE TABLE public.user_personalization (
  id UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  
  -- Basic Info
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  
  -- Investment Goals (multiple selection)
  investment_goals TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  
  -- Risk Tolerance
  risk_tolerance TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (risk_tolerance IN ('conservative', 'moderate', 'aggressive')),
  
  -- Investment Timeline
  investment_timeline TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (investment_timeline IN ('less_than_1_year', '1_to_3_years', '3_to_5_years', '5_to_10_years', '10_plus_years')),
  
  -- Experience Level
  experience_level TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (experience_level IN ('no_experience', 'some_familiarity', 'comfortable', 'professional')),
  
  -- Monthly Investment Goal
  monthly_investment_goal INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 250, -- in dollars
  
  -- Market Interests (multiple selection)
  market_interests TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  
  -- Metadata
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  -- Constraints
  CONSTRAINT user_personalization_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT user_personalization_user_id_key UNIQUE (user_id),
  CONSTRAINT user_personalization_user_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES auth.users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
) TABLESPACE pg_default;

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_user_personalization_user_id ON public.user_personalization USING btree (user_id) TABLESPACE pg_default;

-- Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE public.user_personalization ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS Policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own personalization data" ON public.user_personalization
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own personalization data" ON public.user_personalization
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own personalization data" ON public.user_personalization
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Update trigger for updated_at
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = NOW();
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ language 'plpgsql';

CREATE TRIGGER update_user_personalization_updated_at 
  BEFORE UPDATE ON public.user_personalization 
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();

```

### Phase 2: Updated Onboarding Flow

#### 2.1 Update OnboardingFlow.tsx
Key changes needed:
1. Add "personalization" step to ONBOARDING_STEPS array at index 0
2. Shift all existing step indices by 1 
3. Add new PersonalizationStep component
4. Update progress calculation
5. Add personalization data to state management

```typescript
// Updated ONBOARDING_STEPS
const ONBOARDING_STEPS: Step[] = [
  "personalization", // NEW STEP
  "welcome",
  "contact", 
  "personal",
  "financial",
  "disclosures",
  "agreements",
  "loading",
  "success"
];

// Add to StepIndex enum
enum StepIndex {
  Personalization = 0, // NEW
  Welcome = 1,        // Shifted +1
  Contact = 2,        // Shifted +1
  // ... all others shift +1
}
```

#### 2.2 Create PersonalizationStep Component
Create `frontend-app/components/onboarding/PersonalizationStep.tsx`:

Mobile-first design with:
- Name input field
- Card-based goal selection (max 3)
- Risk tolerance with emoji indicators
- Timeline slider
- Experience level cards
- Monthly investment range slider  
- Market interests grid (max 5)

#### 2.3 Update WelcomePage Component
Update text to:
- "Hey there! I'm Clera. I'm your personal investment advisor here to help you with anything investment related. But before we start with that, let's get your account set up."
- Update step descriptions to show 4 steps instead of 3
- Use personalized greeting: "It's nice to meet you {firstName}"

### Phase 3: AI Agent Context Injection

#### 3.1 Create Personalization Context Service
Create `frontend-app/utils/services/personalization-service.ts`:

```typescript
export class PersonalizationService {
  static async getPersonalizationContext(userId: string): Promise<string> {
    // Fetch personalization data from Supabase
    // Format into structured prompt context
    // Return formatted string for AI agent
  }
  
  static formatPersonalizationPrompt(data: PersonalizationData): string {
    // Convert data into natural language context
    // E.g., "The user's investment goals include saving for retirement and buying a house. 
    //       They have a moderate risk tolerance and plan to invest for 5-10 years..."
  }
}
```

#### 3.2 Update Chat Message Construction
**Option A: Frontend Injection (Recommended)**
- Modify chat components to fetch personalization data
- Append context to user messages before sending
- Maintains existing backend architecture

**Option B: Backend Injection** 
- Modify backend LangGraph config to include personalization
- Fetch data server-side and inject into agent context
- More secure but requires backend changes

#### 3.3 Context Template Design
```typescript
const PERSONALIZATION_TEMPLATE = `
User Context:
- Name: {firstName}
- Investment Goals: {goals}
- Risk Tolerance: {riskTolerance} 
- Investment Timeline: {timeline}
- Experience Level: {experienceLevel}
- Monthly Investment Budget: ${monthlyInvestmentRange}
- Market Interests: {marketInterests}

Please provide personalized advice based on this context. Tailor your recommendations to their goals, risk tolerance, and experience level.

User Message: {actualUserMessage}
`;
```

### Phase 4: Dashboard Goals Section

#### 4.1 Create Goals Management Component
Create `frontend-app/components/dashboard/GoalsSection.tsx`:

Features:
- Display current investment goals as cards
- Edit functionality with modal/inline editing
- Add/remove goals
- Progress tracking (future enhancement)

#### 4.2 Update Dashboard Layout
Add goals section to existing dashboard grid layout:
```tsx
{/* Row 3: Goals Section */}
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-6">
  <GoalsSection userId={user.id} />
</div>
```

#### 4.3 Goals Update API Routes
Create `/api/personalization/goals/route.ts`:
- GET: Fetch current goals
