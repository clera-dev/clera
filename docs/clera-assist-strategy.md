- **Error States:** Helpful fallback prompts for troubleshooting

## Visual Consistency

- Uniform button styling (`clera-assist-button`) 
- Predictable positioning (header area when possible)
- Mobile-optimized interactions

## User Experience Goals
1. **Predictability:** Users learn to expect assistance everywhere
2. **Relevance:** Each prompt matches the sophistication of the component
3. **Progression:** Guide users from simple to complex concepts
4. **Consistency:** Same interaction patterns across all components
