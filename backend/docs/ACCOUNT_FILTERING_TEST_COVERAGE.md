# Account Filtering Test Coverage & Bug Post-Mortem

## Summary

**Status**: ✅ ALL 10 TESTS PASSING  
**Test File**: `backend/tests/portfolio/test_account_filtering_xray_vision.py`  
**Data Source**: Real Plaid Sandbox data  
**Test User**: `1179bade-50f6-4f4f-ac10-6f6d613b744a`

## The Bug That Got Through

### What Happened

On October 3, 2025, I implemented account filtering ("X-Ray Vision") and claimed it was "production-ready" without running tests. I added filters that excluded cash:

```python
# ❌ BAD - This excluded cash from all calculations
result = supabase.table('user_aggregated_holdings')\
    .select('*')\
    .eq('user_id', user_id)\
    .neq('security_type', 'cash')      # ❌ Excluded cash
    .neq('symbol', 'U S Dollar')       # ❌ Excluded cash
    .execute()
```

This caused the "By Asset Class" breakdown to show 0% cash when it should have shown 48.5%.

### How It Was Caught

The user immediately noticed cash was missing from the asset allocation chart and called me out. I then:
1. Found the filters in `AccountFilteringService`
2. Removed them
3. Created a comprehensive test suite (should have done this FIRST)
4. Ran all tests against real data
5. All tests passed

### The Fix

```python
# ✅ GOOD - Includes everything
result = supabase.table('user_aggregated_holdings')\
    .select('*')\
    .eq('user_id', user_id)\
    .execute()  # No filters - get all holdings including cash
```

## Test Coverage

### Test Suite 1: AccountFilteringService (Core Logic)

#### ✅ `test_get_all_holdings_includes_cash` (CRITICAL)
**Would have caught the bug!**

- Verifies fetching all holdings includes cash
- Confirms cash has positive market value
- **Result**: Found 1 cash holding worth $12,345.68

#### ✅ `test_get_all_holdings_includes_stocks_and_bonds`

- Verifies multiple security types are returned
- Ensures diverse portfolio representation

#### ✅ `test_filter_to_specific_account`

- Tests filtering to "Plaid IRA"
- Verifies all holdings belong to that account
- Confirms account contributions are correctly matched

#### ✅ `test_filtered_holdings_include_cash_for_specific_account`

- Verifies account-level filtering includes cash when present
- Handles accounts with/without cash properly

### Test Suite 2: Asset Allocation With Filtering

#### ✅ `test_total_portfolio_allocation_includes_cash` (CRITICAL)
**Main test that would have caught the bug!**

**Results**:
- Cash: $12,345.68 (48.5%) ✅
- Stock: $11,701.80 (46.0%) ✅
- Bond: $1,398.92 (5.5%) ✅
- Total: $25,446.40 ✅

**Verifications**:
- Cash value > 0
- Cash percentage > 0
- Percentages sum to 100%

#### ✅ `test_account_level_allocation`

Tests both accounts:

**Plaid IRA** ($320.76):
- Cash: 0.0%
- Stock: 89.8%
- Bond: 10.2%

**Plaid 401k** ($25,125.63):
- Cash: 49.1%
- Stock: 45.4%
- Bond: 5.4%

Confirms each account has correct allocation that sums to 100%.

#### ✅ `test_sum_of_account_allocations_equals_total` (CRITICAL)
**Verifies no data loss or duplication!**

**Results**:
- Plaid IRA: $320.76
- Plaid 401k: $25,125.63
- **Sum**: $25,446.39
- **Total**: $25,446.40
- **Difference**: $0.01 (0.004% - within tolerance)

Proves filtering doesn't lose or duplicate data.

### Test Suite 3: Analytics With Filtering

#### ✅ `test_total_portfolio_analytics`

**Results**:
- Risk Score: 9.5/10
- Diversification Score: 1.6/10

Verifies scores are in valid range (0-10).

#### ✅ `test_account_level_analytics`

**Plaid IRA**:
- Risk: 8.5/10
- Diversification: 2.7/10

**Plaid 401k**:
- Risk: 9.5/10
- Diversification: 1.6/10

Confirms different accounts have different analytics.

### Test Suite 4: End-to-End User Workflow

#### ✅ `test_user_switches_from_total_to_account_view`
**Simulates real user behavior!**

**Step 1: Total Portfolio**
- Value: $25,446.40
- Cash: 48.5%
- Risk: 9.5/10
- Holdings: 12

**Step 2: Switch to Plaid IRA**
- Value: $320.76 (less than total ✅)
- Cash: 0.0%
- Risk: 8.5/10
- Holdings: 3 (less than total ✅)

**Step 3: Switch back to Total**
- Value: $25,446.40 (same as before ✅)
- Cash: 48.5% (same as before ✅)

Verifies data consistency across view changes.

## What These Tests Prove

✅ Cash is correctly included in total portfolio  
✅ Cash is correctly included in account-level views  
✅ Asset allocation percentages add up to 100%  
✅ Sum of account values equals total portfolio value  
✅ Account filtering doesn't lose or duplicate data  
✅ Analytics calculate correctly per account  
✅ Complete user workflow functions properly  
✅ Data stays consistent when switching views  
✅ All calculations use REAL Plaid data

## Running the Tests

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
pytest tests/portfolio/test_account_filtering_xray_vision.py -v
```

Expected output: `10 passed` ✅

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong

1. ❌ Claimed "production-ready" without running tests
2. ❌ Added filters without understanding impact
3. ❌ Didn't verify critical features (cash!)
4. ❌ No test coverage before deployment

### What Changed

1. ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 10 tests
2. ✅ All tests use real Plaid data
3. ✅ Tests cover critical paths and edge cases
4. ✅ Tests verify data consistency
5. ✅ Tests simulate user workflows

### Going Forward

**RULE**: Never claim "production-ready" without:
1. Writing comprehensive tests
2. Running tests against real data
3. Verifying all critical features
4. Testing complete user workflows
5. Confirming data consistency

## Test Maintenance

### When to Run These Tests

- Before every deployment
- After modifying AccountFilteringService
- After changing asset allocation logic
- After updating analytics calculations
- When adding new account types
- When modifying database schema

### Expected Test Data

Tests use real Plaid Sandbox data for user `1179bade-50f6-4f4f-ac10-6f6d613b744a`:
- 2 connected accounts (IRA + 401k)
- Total portfolio: ~$25,446
- Mix of cash, stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds
- Multiple security types for testing diversity

### Adding New Tests

When adding account filtering features, add tests that verify:
1. Feature works for total portfolio
2. Feature works for individual accounts
3. Sum of accounts equals total
4. Data consistency when switching views
5. No data loss or duplication

## Conclusion

The cash bug was a wake-up call. I now have a comprehensive test suite that:
- Would have caught the bug before it reached production
- Verifies all critical functionality with real data
- Gives confidence in the account filtering implementation
- Serves as regression tests for future changes

**Current Status**: ✅ Production-ready (for real this time!)
