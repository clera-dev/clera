# Edge Cases Analysis - All Gaps Solved

## Critical Gaps Found & Fixed

### ‚úÖ GAP #1: Network Partition (CRITICAL - FIXED)

**Scenario:** Task is leader but loses Redis connectivity

**Problem:**
```
Time 0s: Task A is leader, services running
Time 10s: Network partition (can't reach Redis)
Time 30s: Redis lock expires
Time 30s: Task B becomes leader
Time 31s: Network recovers
         ‚Üí Task A still thinks it's leader
         ‚Üí Task A and B BOTH running services! ‚ùå
```

**Solution Implemented:**
```python
# Continuously monitor leadership status every 5 seconds
while not tracker_task.done():
    await asyncio.sleep(5)
    
    if not leader_service.is_leader:
        logger.error("‚ö†Ô∏è  LOST LEADERSHIP! Stopping immediately")
        tracker_task.cancel()
        raise Exception("Lost leadership")
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Services stop within 5 seconds of losing leadership

---

### ‚úÖ GAP #2: Background Service Ignores Cancellation (CRITICAL - FIXED)

**Scenario:** Intraday tracker doesn't handle CancelledError properly

**Problem:**
```python
# OLD CODE:
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error: {e}")  # ‚ùå Catches CancelledError!
```

**Solution Implemented:**
```python
# NEW CODE:
except asyncio.CancelledError:
    logger.info("Loop cancelled (shutdown)")
    raise  # ‚úÖ Re-raise to propagate
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Graceful shutdown now works correctly

---

### ‚úÖ GAP #3: Thundering Herd (FIXED)

**Scenario:** All tasks retry at same time

**Problem:**
```
Time 10s: Task A, B, C all retry ‚Üí All hit Redis
Time 20s: Task A, B, C all retry ‚Üí All hit Redis
         ‚Üí Wasted resources, Redis load spike
```

**Solution Implemented:**
```python
# Add jitter to retry interval (¬±20%)
jitter = random.uniform(0.8, 1.2)
sleep_time = retry_interval * jitter
await asyncio.sleep(sleep_time)
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Tasks retry at staggered times

---

### ‚úÖ GAP #4: No Alerting for Long Retry Periods (FIXED)

**Scenario:** Old task takes 5 minutes to shut down

**Problem:**
- No visibility into extended retry periods
- No warning if something is wrong

**Solution Implemented:**
```python
if retry_count == 1:
    logger.info("Waiting for current leader...")
elif retry_count % 6 == 0:  # Every minute
    logger.warning(f"‚è∞ Still waiting after {retry_count} attempts")
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Warning logs every 60 seconds

## Edge Cases Already Handled

### ‚úÖ SIGKILL (Already Handled)

**Scenario:** Task receives SIGKILL (no graceful shutdown)

**How It's Handled:**
- Redis lock has 30-second TTL
- Lock automatically expires
- New task becomes leader

**Downtime:** 30 seconds (acceptable)

---

### ‚úÖ Multiple Tasks Start Simultaneously (Already Handled)

**Scenario:** Scaling from count:1 to count:3

**How It's Handled:**
- Redis SET NX is atomic
- Only ONE task succeeds
- Others retry with jitter

**Result:** No race conditions

---

### ‚úÖ Race Condition During Transition (Already Handled)

**Scenario:** Old task releases lock at exact moment new task checks

**How It's Handled:**
- Redis operations are atomic
- SET NX guarantees only one succeeds

**Result:** No duplicate leaders

---

### ‚úÖ Zombie Task (Already Handled)

**Scenario:** Task freezes but holds lock

**How It's Handled:**
- Redis TTL expires after 30 seconds
- ECS kills frozen task (health check)
- New leader takes over

**Downtime:** 30 seconds (acceptable)

---

## Remaining Edge Cases (Acceptable)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Redis Becomes Read-Only

**Scenario:** Redis failover, becomes read-only temporarily

**Impact:**
- No task can become leader
- Background services stop
- HTTP API continues working

**Mitigation:**
- ElastiCache has automatic failover
- Typically resolves in seconds
- CloudWatch alerts should notify ops team

**Decision:** Acceptable - rare event, self-healing

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 30-Second Downtime on SIGKILL

**Scenario:** Task is SIGKILL'd without graceful shutdown

**Impact:**
- Lock held for 30 seconds (TTL)
- Background services paused for 30 seconds

**Mitigation:**
- Could reduce lease duration to 20s or 15s
- Trade-off: More heartbeat overhead

**Decision:** Acceptable - SIGKILL is rare

## Production Improvements

### 1. Continuous Leadership Monitoring
- ‚úÖ Check every 5 seconds
- ‚úÖ Stop services immediately if lost
- ‚úÖ Prevents split-brain scenarios

### 2. Retry Jitter
- ‚úÖ ¬±20% randomness
- ‚úÖ Prevents thundering herd
- ‚úÖ Reduces Redis load spikes

### 3. Progress Logging
- ‚úÖ Initial attempt logged
- ‚úÖ Warning every minute
- ‚úÖ Success with retry count

### 4. Proper Cancellation
- ‚úÖ CancelledError re-raised
- ‚úÖ Graceful shutdown guaranteed
- ‚úÖ Leadership released in finally
