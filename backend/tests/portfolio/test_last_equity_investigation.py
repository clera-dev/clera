"""
Focused test to investigate the last_equity issue.
The problem: last_equity shows $143,910.89 but current is $153,850.05 (6.91% gap)
This suggests last_equity is stale or from an old date.

This test uses dependency injection and mocking to maintain proper separation of concerns
and avoid hard dependencies on external infrastructure.
