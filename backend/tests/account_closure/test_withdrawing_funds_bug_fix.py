CRITICAL BUG FIX TESTS: WITHDRAWING_FUNDS Step Logic

This test suite validates the fix for the critical bug where accounts
would get stuck in WITHDRAWING_FUNDS step without ever initiating the withdrawal.

ORIGINAL BUG:
- Account had cash_balance = cash_withdrawable = $98,013.88 (fully settled)
- System was stuck in WITHDRAWING_FUNDS step for over a week
- ready_for_next_step = False, next_action = "wait"
- No withdrawal was ever initiated

ROOT CAUSE:
- is_ready_for_next_step() for WITHDRAWING_FUNDS only returned True when cash_balance <= 1.0
- resume_closure_process() assumed withdrawal was already initiated and just waited

FIX:
- is_ready_for_next_step() now returns True when funds are ready to withdraw OR withdrawal is complete
- resume_closure_process() now actually initiates withdrawal when funds are settled

This test ensures this critical bug never happens again.
