Comprehensive Tests for Account Closure Resume Functionality

This test suite validates the critical resume_closure_process method and 
the resume API endpoints that were missing from the original implementation.

CRITICAL TESTS:
- Tests the resume_closure_process method exists and works correctly
- Tests all possible closure states and transitions
- Tests automatic step progression logic
- Tests error handling and edge cases
- Tests API endpoint integration
- Tests security and authentication

This addresses the production-critical bug where:
1. resume_account_closure() called manager.resume_closure_process() but the method didn't exist
2. Frontend called /api/account-closure/resume/{accountId} but no endpoint existed
